# Machine Learning Labs

### lab1 – Overfitting vs. Underfitting
Trained linear regression models using the least squares method to explore the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting.

### lab2 – k-Nearest Neighbours and Cross-Validation
Implemented the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) algorithm and evaluated model performance using cross-validation techniques.

### lab3 – Image Compression with k-Means Clustering
Applied k-means clustering for image segmentation and compression to reduce storage size while preserving visual quality.

### lab4 – Neural Networks
Built a neural network from scratch with backpropagation training, then reimplemented the model using PyTorch for comparison.

### lab5 – Reinforcement Learning Hackathon 2024
Developed and trained reinforcement learning agents in the Lunar Lander environment using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
