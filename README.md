# Machine Learning
lab1 - Trade-off between Overfitting and Underfitting (Train linear regression models use least squares linear regreesion method)\
lab2 - Nearest Neighbours and Cross-validation (KNN algorithm)\
lab3 - k-Means Clustering for Image Segmentation and Compression (Compress image use k-means clustering algorithm)\
lab4 - Neural Networks (Implment neural networds from scatach and train with backpropagation, then use pytorch to implement the same network)\
lab5 - Reinforcement Learning Hackathon 2024 (Develop and train a RL agent under Lunar Lander env, apply Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks(DQN))
